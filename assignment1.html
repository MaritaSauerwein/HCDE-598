            <h1>Attempt 1: failure</h1>
            <p>

           My plan for attempt 1 was to first print the corners of the triangle and than to ‘close’ the shape by printing on the pattern:
            </p>
            <img src="plan.JPG" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to print the corners I had to position the triangle in the right place and start the print at the right height. 
            I tried this first with a grid and than levelling the printer bed, bbut in the end I printed a flat square on the printer bed, 
            placed the triangle and than continue the print on the right height. The print warped at first, but by turning the vans off 
            the print worked quite well.

            <img src="triangle2.JPG" height=200></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The triangle stuck to the wood, but not very well, 
                which turned out to be a major problem to connect the wooden parts in the next print, the print on the flat surface. 
                Although I made several parts to position the wood and prints and keep them in place, it did not work. 
                It was just not stable enough and there where to many loose parts:

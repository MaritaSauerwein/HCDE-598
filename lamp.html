To further explore the shapes, I commited to this week assigment and designed a hexagon lampshade, which will look more or less like this:
            </p>
                <img src="L1.JPG" height=200></a>

       <p>
            </p>
               The angles of a hexagon are bigger than a triangle and this resulted in some printing problems, as shown below on the left. 
               Therefore I decided to support the print with a pattern that complements the design. This worked better as shown on the right.

                   <img src="L3.JPG" height=200></a>
</p>
For the lasercut I made the following design in grasshopper 
  </p>
                <img src="L41.JPG" height=300></a>
                <img src="L43.JPG" height=300></a>
                <img src="L42.JPG" height=300></a>

       <p>
            </p>
            The pattern is partly hatched to print on lateron and partly cut for a light effect. 
            I set the coordinates of the lasercutter for the first cut, turned the cut pieces around while leaving the plate in place and 
            used the same coordinates for the hatch on the backside. This worked well: 
              </p>
                <img src="L4.JPG" height=200></a>

       <p>
            </p>
And the pieces fitted nicely together:

                <img src="L5.JPG" height=200></a>
                <img src="L6.JPG" height=200></a>

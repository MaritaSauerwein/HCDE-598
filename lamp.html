            <h1>Lampshade</h1>
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>

            </p>
To further explore the shapes, I commited to this week assigment and designed a hexagon lampshade, which will look more or less like this:
            </p>
                <img src="L1.JPG" height=200></a>

       <p>
            </p>
               The angles of a hexagon are bigger than a triangle and this resulted in some printing problems, as shown below on the left. 
               Therefore I decided to support the print with a pattern that complements the design. This worked better as shown on the right.
            </p>
                <img src="L2.JPG" height=200></a>
                   <img src="L3.JPG" height=200></a>

</p>
For the lasercut I made the following design in grasshopper 
  </p>
                <img src="L41.JPG" height=350></a>
                <img src="L43.JPG" height=350></a>
</p>
                <img src="L42.JPG" width=1010></a>

       <p>
            </p>
            The pattern is partly hatched to print on later on and partly cut for a light effect. 
            I set the coordinates of the lasercutter for the first cut, turned the cut pieces around while leaving the plate in place and 
            used the same coordinates for the hatch on the backside. This worked well: 
              </p>
                <img src="L4.JPG" height=200></a>

       <p>
            </p>
And the pieces fitted nicely together, so I printed the other legs as well. 
 </p>
                <img src="L5.JPG" height=200></a>
                <img src="L6.JPG" height=200></a>
                <img src="L7.JPG" height=200></a>

       <p>
           Next, I printed the insert that will hold the lamp and placed the lampshade around it
            </p>
                        <img src="L8.JPG" height=200></a>
                <img src="L9.JPG" height=200></a>
 </p>
Now it was time to close the connection pieces with a 3D print. With the help of Hannah, we have wroten a script in python to move the print up,
since cura does not allow this without support. This is the script we wrote: 

                 <p>
                 <a href="hello.py">change Z-axis in gcode</a>
               </p>
               <img class="inline" src="hello.py" width=30%></a>

             </div>

Although the pieces held the lamp together, it was not very stable. 
So I supported it with clamps and clamped the lamp to the printbed. However, since the clamp is placed under the printbed, I first had to pause the print,
than clamp the lamp to the printerbed, kind of keep the lamp in place with my hands and the clamps and turn the printer off as soon as the print is finished,
to avoid the printbed to go down. So not very precise and automated yet...
